Top 3 Meter Ranking:
  Meter        | Score | Compliance | Description
  ------------ | ----- | ---------- | -----------
  Acti9 iEM3100 |   3   | 3/5 (60%)  | The iEM3100 is a basic energy meter for direct measurement up to 63 A. It provides essential total and partial active energy counting, making it an economical choice for simple energy consumption monitoring and sub-metering applications.
  EasyLogic PM2220 |   3   | 3/5 (60%)  | The PM2220 is a versatile meter that combines a graphical LCD display with RS-485 communication. It's an excellent choice for networked applications that benefit from enhanced local data visualization and require basic power quality insights, including up to 15th order harmonics and voltage unbalance monitoring.
  PowerLogic PM8143 |   3   | 3/5 (60%)  | The PM8143 is the DIN rail-mounted version of the Essential feature set meter, designed for applications where an integrated display is not required. It offers the same core functionality as the PM8140 and can be connected to a remote display for local viewing.
