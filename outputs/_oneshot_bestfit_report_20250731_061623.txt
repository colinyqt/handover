  PowerLogic PM5331 |   3   | 3/8 (37%)  | The PM5331 is the revenue-certified version of the PM5330, adding MID/MIR compliance for billing applications . It combines Class 0.5S accuracy, expanded I/O (2 DI/2 DO), and serial communication, making it suitable for tenant billing and cost allocation that requires regulatory approval.
  Acti9 iEM3255 |   3   | 3/8 (37%)  | The iEM3255 is a current transformer (CT) connected energy meter offering high accuracy (Class 0.5S) for billing applications. It provides four-quadrant energy measurement, a digital I/O, multi-tariff functions, and Modbus communication, making it ideal for monitoring mains or critical feeders in low and medium voltage networks.
  PowerLogic PM8210 |   3   | 3/8 (37%)  | The PM8210 is the low-voltage DC variant of the Standard power meter. It provides comprehensive power quality analysis with a higher sampling rate and more memory than the essential model, and is designed for systems with a 20-60 V DC control power supply.

=== Clause: RMS Disturbances ===

Requirements:
- Records both waveforms and rms plots for rms disturbances
- Stores a trend plot of the rms voltage during the disturbance, including at least 5 cycles of pre-trigger data and 25 cycles of post-event data, with user-defined durations
- Stores actual waveforms (voltage and current) during the disturbance, including user-defined pre-event and post-event cycles
- Characterizes rms disturbances according to IEC 61000-4-30 requirements
- Triggers on one-cycle or longer variations in the rms voltage level outside user-defined thresholds for both voltages (L-N and L-L) and currents
