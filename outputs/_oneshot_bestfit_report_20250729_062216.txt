  ------------ | ----- | ---------- | -----------
  PowerLogic PM8110 |   3   | 3/17 (17%) | The PM8110 is the low-voltage DC variant of the Essential power meter. It provides the same versatile power monitoring and WAGES metering with a color TFT display, but is designed for systems with a 20-60 V DC control power supply.
  PowerLogic PM8243 |   2   | 2/17 (11%) | The PM8243 is the DIN rail-mounted version of the Standard feature set meter, designed for applications where an integrated display is not required. It offers the same core functionality as the PM8240 and can be connected to a remote display for local viewing.
  EasyLogic PM2220 |   2   | 2/17 (11%) | The PM2220 is a versatile meter that combines a graphical LCD display with RS-485 communication. It's an excellent choice for networked applications that benefit from enhanced local data visualization and require basic power quality insights, including up to 15th order harmonics and voltage unbalance monitoring.
