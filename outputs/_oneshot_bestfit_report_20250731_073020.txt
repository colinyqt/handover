=== Clause: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION – ELECTRICAL SERVICES ===

Requirements:
- Memory capacity for 36 months data
- RS485 communication interface
- Accuracy class 0.5
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) per phase, voltage & current up to 31st harmonic order ±1%
- Voltage range 400V/230V
- Frequency ±0.5%
- Current transformer secondary 5A


=== Clause: RMS Disturbances ===

Requirements:
- Characterizes rms disturbances according to IEC 61000-4-30 requirements
- Triggers on one-cycle or longer variations in the rms voltage level outside user-defined thresholds for both voltages (L-N and L-L) and currents
- Stores a trend plot of the rms voltage during the disturbance, including at least 5 cycles of pre-trigger data and 25 cycles of post-event data, with user-defined pre-event and post-event durations
- Records both waveforms and rms plots for rms disturbances
- Stores actual waveforms (voltage and current) during the disturbance, including user-defined pre-event and post-event cycles
