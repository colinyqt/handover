  PowerLogic PM8110 |   2   | 2/3 (66%)  | The PM8110 is the low-voltage DC variant of the Essential power meter. It provides the same versatile power monitoring and WAGES metering with a color TFT display, but is designed for systems with a 20-60 V DC control power supply.
  PowerLogic PM8243 |   2   | 2/3 (66%)  | The PM8243 is the DIN rail-mounted version of the Standard feature set meter, designed for applications where an integrated display is not required. It offers the same core functionality as the PM8240 and can be connected to a remote display for local viewing.
  PowerLogic PM8343 |   1   | 1/3 (33%)  | The PM8343 is the DIN rail-mounted version of the Advanced feature set meter, designed for applications where an integrated display is not required. It offers the same core functionality as the PM8340 and can be connected to a remote display for local viewing.

=== Clause: Electrical Services (1.20.7 PQM) ===

Clause Text:
The unit shall trend Voltage, current, power factor, kW, kVAR, and energy. Individual phase quantities and three phase quantities shall be available. These will be provided as maximum, minimum, and average values at user-specified intervals based on continuous sampling and calculation.
Steady state voltage and current profiling
i) A daily trend of envelope data shall be recorded for voltage and current. This trend shall store for each sampling interval (user-specified with a default to ten minutes per IEC specifications) the minimum cycle rms value, maximum cycle rms value, and average rms value over all cycles in the ten minute interval. This information shall be available for all three phases of the voltage and current.
ii) Any violations of the sustained RMS voltage regulation values (duration > 60 seconds and magnitude user definable) shall be recorded and “alarmable”. The total amount of time the regulation limit was violated for each event shall also be recorded.
