=== Clause: RMS Disturbances ===

Requirements:

- Stores a trend plot of the rms voltage during the disturbance, including at least 5 cycles of pre-trigger data and 25 cycles of post-event data, with user-defined pre-event and post-event durations
- Triggers on one-cycle or longer variations in the rms voltage level outside user-defined thresholds for both voltages (L-N and L-L) and currents
- Characterizes rms disturbances according to IEC 61000-4-30 requirements
- Records both waveforms and rms plots for rms disturbances
