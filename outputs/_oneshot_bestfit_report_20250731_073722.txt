=== Clause: Multi-Function Electronic Meters ===

Requirements:
- Current transformer secondary 5A
- Memory capacity for 36 months data
- Frequency ±0.5%
- Voltage range 400V/230V
- Communication interface RS485, RJ45 or similar socket and plug as Approved
- Accuracy class 0.5
- Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) per phase, voltage & current up to 31st harmonic order ±1%


=== Clause: RMS Disturbances ===

Requirements:
- Records both waveforms and rms plots for rms disturbances
- Characterizes rms disturbances according to IEC 61000-4-30 requirements
- Stores actual waveforms (voltage and current) during the disturbance with user-defined pre-event and post-event cycles
- Triggers on one-cycle or longer variations in the rms voltage level outside user-defined thresholds for both voltages (L-N and L-L) and currents
- Stores a trend plot of the rms voltage during the disturbance, including at least 5 cycles of pre-trigger data and 25 cycles of post-event data. Pre-event and post-event durations are user-defined

Top 3 Meter Ranking:
  Meter        | Score | Compliance | Description
  ------------ | ----- | ---------- | -----------
  EasyLogic PM2210 |   3   | 3/5 (60%)  | Select the PM2210 for applications where the enhanced readability of a graphical LCD display is preferred for local monitoring. It serves as the entry-level LCD model, offering basic measurements and a pulse output without advanced communication features.
  Acti9 iEM3110 |   3   | 3/5 (60%)  | The iEM3110 is a 63A direct-measure energy meter that builds on the basic model by adding a configurable pulse output for remote monitoring of energy consumption. It is suitable for integration with PLCs or other basic data acquisition systems.
  PowerLogic ION9000T |   3   | 3/5 (60%)  | The PowerLogic ION9000T extends the capabilities of the advanced ION9000 by adding high-speed transient capture. It detects sub-microsecond transients up to 10 kV with a 10 MHz sampling rate, providing unparalleled insight into transient events for mission-critical power systems.
