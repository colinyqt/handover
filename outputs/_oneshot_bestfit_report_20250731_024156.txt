  PowerLogic PM5330 |   3   | 3/7 (42%)  | The PM5330 builds upon the PM5310 by offering expanded I/O capabilities, including 2 digital inputs and 2 digital outputs , along with a serial port. This makes it suitable for applications requiring basic control or status monitoring in addition to energy metering.
  EasyLogic PM2230 |   3   | 3/7 (42%)  | The PM2230 is the premium model in the series, ideal for critical applications such as sub-billing and advanced power quality analysis. It should be selected when the highest accuracy (Class 0.5S) , detailed harmonic analysis (up to 31st) , data logging, alarming, multi-tariff functions , and I/O expandability  are required.
  PowerLogic PM5100 |   3   | 3/7 (42%)  | The PM5100 is a panel-mounted power meter with a backlit LCD display, providing Class 0.5S accuracy for basic power and energy metering, including power quality analysis up to the 15th harmonic. It is suitable for applications that do not require serial communication but need a digital output for energy pulsing.
