waveform on
voltages and currents on trigger. After a trigger the meter can store up to 100 waveforms with a resolution from 1024 samples/cycle as a minimum
As a minimum, the meter shall be able to provide the following functions:
• On-board memory up to 8 GB.
• Up to 10 programmable recordings with different start and stop time
• provides event recording, waveform capture, waveform display, phasor diagrams,
historical trending, time-of-use etc.
• records of individual order for even and odd harmonic of voltage and current up to 50th order
• Provide a RS485 and/or TCP/IP communication interface to the metering communication network
• Meters shall be tested to IEC 60255 & 61000 Pt 4 & 6.
Others include:
a) Cross triggering. All disturbances will cause all channels (voltage, current, and any additional channels) to be recorded.
b) Triggering shall be on both the line-to-neutral and line-to-line channels. All disturbances will result in recording of both line-to-neutral and line-to-line voltage waveforms.
c) RMS Disturbances.
i) The unit will trigger on one-cycle or longer variations in the rms voltage level, outside user-defined thresholds. Triggering thresholds will be user-defined for both voltages (L-N and L-L) and currents.
ii) The monitor shall characterize rms disturbances according to the requirements of IEC 61000-4-30.
iii) Both waveforms and rms plots will be recorded for rms disturbances.
iv) The initiation of a trigger will cause the instrument to store a trend plot of the rms voltage during the disturbance (both L-N and L-L rms plots will be recorded). This trend will include a minimum of 5 cycles of pre-trigger data, and 25 cycles of post-event data. The pre-event and post-event durations will be user-defined.
v) The initiation of a trigger will cause the instrument to store the actual waveforms (voltage and current) during the disturbance. The waveform recording will include user-defined pre-event and post-event cycles.
