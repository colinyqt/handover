  PowerLogic PM5100 |   3   | 3/15 (20%) | The PM5100 is a panel-mounted power meter with a backlit LCD display, providing Class 0.5S accuracy for basic power and energy metering, including power quality analysis up to the 15th harmonic. It is suitable for applications that do not require serial communication but need a digital output for energy pulsing.
  PowerLogic ION9000T |   3   | 3/15 (20%) | The PowerLogic ION9000T extends the capabilities of the advanced ION9000 by adding high-speed transient capture. It detects sub-microsecond transients up to 10 kV with a 10 MHz sampling rate, providing unparalleled insight into transient events for mission-critical power systems.
  PowerLogic PM8240 |   3   | 3/15 (20%) | The PM8240 is a standard power meter for comprehensive power quality analysis and monitoring. It enhances on the essential model with a higher sampling rate of 256 samples/cycle, significantly more memory (512 MB) for up to 50 data recorders, and Class S power quality measurement according to IEC 61000-4-30.
